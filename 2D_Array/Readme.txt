 Linear Searching is a simple and sequential searching algorithm. It is used to find whether a particular element is present in the array or not by traversing every element in the array. 
 While searching in the 2D array is exactly the same but here all the cells need to be traversed.
 
 First, make a 2d array 
 Then enter the elements of 2D array 
 Afterthat linearly Search the whole matrix and by traversing the every cell find the location of the number here, x in the 2d array
 
 
 SAMPLE INPUT
 1   2   3
 4   5   6
 7   8   9
 
 SAMPLE OUTPUT
 Search for x = 6
 x will be Found at (1,2) location
